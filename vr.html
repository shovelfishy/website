    <h1>The Future of Virtual Reality</h1>
    <h2>By Edward Liew</h2>
    <h3>November 26, 2021</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Virtual reality has always fascinated me as such sophisticated technology. To be able immerse oneself in a completely new world and physically interact with your surroundings. It totally contrasts conventional console, mobile or computer displays where only hand-held input devices are used to interact with what you see on the screen. With VR, there is almost a total connection between the player and the game. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Virtual reality is the creation of an interactive simulated virtual environment viewed and experienced through a head-mounted display accompanied with other controllers or devices. Through VR displays, you can view and interact with a fully simulated environment where the only limitation is your imagination and, well of course, the simulation. Programmers are able to design and render 3D environments and assets, and program softwares for people to experience a whole new world. VR is most commonly used for a new type of gaming experience but with emerging advancements there are more “down-to-earth” practical uses of virtual reality where you’re not taken to some fantasy alternate universe but rather a simulated version of actual reality.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What might the point be if we just simulate an exact copy of reality. Isn’t the point of virtual reality to create cool new places or wacky physics where we can do whatever we want and have fun? That may be one useful utilization of it but VR can also be used to just create virtual scenarios of real life. It totally captivates me that the use of virtual reality to imitate police training is already in the process of being implemented nationwide. Let’s explore this example, one of many.</p>

    <h4>VR NYPD Police Training in 2019</h4>

    <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true">VR was already highly advanced a couple of years ago in the 2020s. There were already great motion capture devices, full body tracking devices, VR treadmills, VR headsets and controllers. However, the goal of VR is to create as much realism and immersiveness as possible. To be able to use VR for extensive police training, the technology needed to be advanced and authentic enough to replicate real-life scenarios. There have been 3 major advancements in the VR industry that were necessary to be able to implement high quality police training in VR. They are namely VR locomotion, motion tracking and graphic or physics improvements.</p>
    <br>
    <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true">Locomotion is the term used to describe how a player would move around in the virtual reality environment. This is perhaps the most important aspect when discussing the practicality of using VR for police training or to substitute any physical activity in general. Currently, the most realistic methods of locomotion are either motion trackers or a VR “treadmill”. These technologies are not new but nowadays, their accuracy and ability to replicate real life movements are far superior. At this point in time, police training mainly uses motion tracking where markers are placed on people and sensors around a room track each player’s movement. They are highly accurate and were the best option for a long time since players could actually move around physically with their body. However, this method takes up a lot of space to set up and the area to move about is definite and limited to the size of the room and coverage of the motion sensors.</p>
    <br>
    <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true">Presently, there are newer versions of VR treadmills, which really aren’t very treadmill-like anymore, that allow for a great range of motion while staying in the same spot. This allows for larger virtual environments. Basically a VR treadmill is an omnidirectional treadmill that allows for a wide range of movement like crouching, crawling, jumping and dodging. It is also connected with the whole VR system and is equipped with a multitude of sensors to track the player’s movement. People are able to move almost completely freely on the VR treadmill that will correspond to the same movement in the virtual world while staying in one small area in real life. One thing you might be thinking about is how would you stop someone from walking through a wall. Sure, you can just tell the players to not walk through but that breaks immersion. With motion tracking in an open room, it isn't possible, at least not easily implemented. With VR treadmills it isn't a big issue because even if you continue to move against the wall, your character's position won't change. Another option that is still somewhat in its development phase is to stop the treadmill from moving and therefore stop the user from continuing to move in that direction. They both have their equal share of flaws but there's just no easy way around this issue and they're still being improved after all.</p>
    <br>
    <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true">Virtual reality can be used to practice communication, de-escalation, conflict resolution, procedures, use of force, formations, protocols, drills, and train police officers for active shootings and other real life scenarios. It is capable of providing officers with significant experience and preparing them for real encounters as much as physical training would. So is VR training better or worse than physical training? Let’s weigh the pros and cons and let you decide for yourself.</p>

    <!-- pros and cons comparison chart -->
    <div class="comparison">
    <div  data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true" class="vr">
      <h2>VR</h2>
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost efficient (equipment is reusable)</li>
        <li>Able to almost fully replicate physical training</li>
        <li>Easily set up real-life scenarios that would be impossible to recreate</li>
        <li>Does not require a lot of space and different scenarios can use the same equipment and space</li>
        <li>Players can be easily tracked and monitored</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Long use of VR is damaging to vision and disorienting for some</li>
        <li>E-waste may become harmful to the environment if not disposed of properly</li>
        <li>Expensive investment initially</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-once="true" class="physical">
      <h2>Physical</h2>
      <h3>Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most realistic <strong style="font-size:15px;">(obviously)</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>*That’s basically it but this single point includes an array of subpoints such as better preparation when dispatched, more in touch with the real world, and better physics or interactions with the environment and people</p>

      <h3>Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Some things are non-reusable (ex. bullet rounds)</li>
        <li>Limited to resources and space</li>
        <li>Situations need to be carefully created and set up</li>
        <li>Location for different scenarios need to be selected</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true">And with even better AI and machine learning technology, developments are being made to create simulated criminals and victims for emotional intelligence training so that police have a chance to experience what it’s really like to handle and talk to criminals and victims who probably would be overwhelmed with emotions in the moment.</p>
    <br>
    <p data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true">New locomotive options combined with better graphics, physics and motion capture means that VR has taken a great leap towards total immersiveness and realism. As it stands now, the technology is advanced enough to be implemented in police academies’ training programs. Technology will only improve with time and so will the quality of training, which translates to better police officers who can continue to serve and protect society to the best of their abilities. And if you truly take a moment to reflect upon this great feat and appreciate its grandeur, it really is unbelievable how far we’ve come; to imagine that we’d be able to replace actual physical police training, which honestly should be relying on real interactions with real objects so as to prepare police officers in the best way possible, with a digital alternative.</p>
